how to use the code:

for debugging: sensor check (reflectance, ultrasonic, distance) and motor control (going forwards, backwards, turning left, right)

section one is line following, checks for normal line, dotted line, forks, sharp turns
uses a combination of 9 vertical sensors, 9 horizontal sensors, 2 leftward and 2 rightward sensors

section two is wall following and obstacles, uses a pd controller to keep the robot parallel between both walls and centre it

lava pit code is for section three; uses the 270Ëš servo to activate the scissor lift; for the 3rd section for lava pit and zipline
